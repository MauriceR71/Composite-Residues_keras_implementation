# Composite Residues keras implementation

Implementation of the "Composite Residues" neural network architecture used in [Toward machine-guided design of proteins](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/06/02/337154.full.pdf).
The article does show a diagram of the network architecture but provides no implementation.
Here I implement it in keras.
